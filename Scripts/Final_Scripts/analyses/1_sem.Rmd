##Introduction
In this script, I do structural equation modeling to understand causal relationships between 
environmental drives and stability at the biome scale.

##Data input
```{r}
#response- "stable" area derived from analyses of satellite derived vegetation productivity 
ndvi_unstable<- rast(here("Outputs", "TrendsResults", "results_rasters", "monthly" , "unstablearea_5km", "monthlyswin11_ndvi_unstablearea.tif"))

#drivers of "instability"
anthropic_dist<- rast(here("Outputs", "OtherVariables", "AnthropicDist", "5km_meandist_20thresholdsanthropicpixel.tif"))
hand<- rast(here("Outputs", "OtherVariables","HAND", "cerrado_hand_5km.tif"))

burnedarea<- rast(here("Outputs", "OtherVariables", "Fire", "theilsen_burnedarea_5km.tif"))
re<- rast(here("Outputs", "OtherVariables", "Climate", "theilsen_re.tif"))
mat<- rast(here("Outputs", "OtherVariables", "Climate", "theilsen_at_5km.tif"))
spei<- rast(here("Outputs", "OtherVariables", "Climate", "theilsen_spei.tif"))
heatwave<- rast(here("Outputs", "OtherVariables", "Climate", "theilsen_heatwaves.tif"))
savannapercentage <- rast(here("Outputs", "OtherVariables", "Formations_Heterogeniety", "theilsen_savannapercentage.tif"))
```

1) anthropic_dist - distance of the particular 5x5km grid cell to the closest anthropogenic land use
2) hand - water table depth, so value is the water table depth in meters

3) burnedarea - trend in the proportion of the 5x5km grid cell that burned through time
trend is calculated as the slope of a theilsen regression of annual burned area ~ time (21 years).
This theilsen regression has been applied to other "temporal" predictor variables explained below.
Basically the value in this column of the df is the slope from theilsen regression.
4) re- this is relative entropy which is a metric of seasonality. So positive slope values
means that actual rainfall in the 5x5km grid cell is becoming different from a equal amount of rainfall through the year 
(like uniform distribution across 12 months) faster and negative values is the same meaning but slower
4) mat - trend in annual temp. Similar interpretation- postive values mean that 
that 5x5km grid cell is getting hotter 
5) spei- this variable is also a trend where negative values mean that overall there are more droughts and
positive values mean that there are less droughts
6) heatwave- positive values means annual number of heatwaves is increasing 
7) savannapercentage- area of savanna vegetation in the 5x5 km grid cell that is increasing (positive values)
Above variables has not unit because its all slope. All trend varibales were calculated between 2002 and 2021.


##Preprocessing of all data- making appropriate data structure ie makign a dataframe (df) from 
geospatial data format
```{r}
drivers<- c(anthropic_dist, burnedarea, hand, re, mat, heatwave, spei, savannapercentage)
drivers
names(drivers)<- c("anthropic_dist", "burnedarea", "hand", "re", "mat", "heatwave", "spei", "savannapercentage")

instability<- c(ndvi_unstable)
names(instability)<- c("NDVI_instability")

all_data<- c(instability, drivers)
analyses_df<- terra::as.data.frame(all_data)
remove( ndvi_unstable, anthropic_dist, burnedarea, hand, re, mat, heatwave, spei, savannapercentage)
remove(drivers, instability)
```

#Exploratory data analyses
First because the sample size is the population, I know that all test statistics will
be unreliable, especially statistics like chi sq that are dependent on sample size. 
Hence I sample a % of the total data to run the SEM. I also plot the 
data to check if the different variables follow a Guassian distribution. 

I also scale the dataframe because all the units and magnitudes of variables int he df are 
very different.
```{r}
analyses_df
summary(analyses_df)
analyses_df_NA <- analyses_df %>% drop_na() #Removing rows with NA values i.e. applying anthropic mask

### Sampling 30% of the data resulting in 6306 rows of data
set.seed(1000)
sample_df<- analyses_df_NA %>% slice_sample(prop=0.3, replace= FALSE) #30% randomly sampled of entire dataset
summary(sample_df)

library(PerformanceAnalytics)
chart.Correlation(sample_df, histogram = TRUE, pch= 19)

#Removing outliers considering distribution of height above nearest drainage variable
no_outliers_sample_df <- sample_df %>% 
          mutate (IQR = IQR(hand),
                  O_upper = quantile (hand, probs= c(0.75), na.rm= FALSE)+ 1.5*IQR,
                  O_lower = quantile(hand, probs= c(0.25), na.rm= FALSE) - 1.5*IQR
                  ) %>% 
          filter(O_lower <= hand & hand <= O_upper) %>%
          dplyr::select(-c(IQR, O_upper, O_lower))

chart.Correlation(no_outliers_sample_df, histogram = TRUE, pch= 19)

### Scaling data by centering around means due as the units and values of all variables are very different
scaled_analyses_ndviinstability<- data.frame(scale(no_outliers_sample_df, center= TRUE, scale= TRUE)) 

### Checking the covariance matrix of scaled data
cov_matrix_scaled_data <- cov(scaled_analyses_ndviinstability)

#plot of distributions of scaled data
pivot_df <- scaled_analyses_ndviinstability  %>%
  pivot_longer(1:9)
distribution_plot <- ggplot(data = pivot_df, aes(value)) +
  geom_histogram() +facet_wrap(~name, scales = "free", labeller = label_wrap_gen(4)) +
  theme_classic(base_size = 16)
distribution_plot

```
Response variables of "stable" area is right skewed (because most of the Brazilian savanna biome is stable).
Most of the drivers/predictors are normally distributed.

Verification of model fit ie the acceptable range of values of various model fit statistics can be taken from
https://www.smartpls.com/documentation/functionalities/thresholds
which includes the thresholds used by SmartPLS software.

#Analyses - 2- using H-O specification
Based on Yu et al 2025- A flexible way to study composites in ecology using structural equation modeling, I decided
to use the H-O specification to overcome the problems of 2 step (above chunk and generally used for composited) and 1 step
SEM. As per Schuberth's email, cSEM freely estimates the weights of the composites using partial least square path modelling. 
So implementing H-O with free weights option.
