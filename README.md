# ecothresholds
This repository contains the scripts that were generated as part of the study
estimating ecosystem transitions across the Cerrado, Brazil's savanna biome. 
This project was completed mainly at the University of Exeter and at the University
of Bristol, funded by UKRI NERC and Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851.

All scripts are in 7 subfolders, numbered indicating the order in which the scripts 
can be run.
